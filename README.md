# SQL Trainer

This project aims to provide a relatively simple interface for learning and experimenting with database concepts via SQL. It uses [SQL.js](https://sql.js.org/) to provide one or more [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) databases, and uses [IndexedDB](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) to persist those databases. Everything runs in the browser.
